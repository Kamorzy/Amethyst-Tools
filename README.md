# Amethyst Tools
## Purpose
Amethyst tools are meant to be an early game alternative to rushing for diamond. They are much better than iron if you can find a geode early. However, since finding geodes is unreliable, its most common use is likely for players who'd rather take their time in the early game, but want to still build things without having to constantly replace iron tools.

## Mechanics
- Crafted using amethyst clusters
- Breaking a budding amethyst block with any pickaxe now drops 0-1 amethyst cluster
- Amethyst tools have the mining level of iron, so they can't mine obsidian
- Increased enchantability compared to most other tool materials

## Q&A

_Why craft using Amethyst Clusters instead of Amethyst Shards?_

Other amethyst tool mods tended to use shards, but I didn't like it. I felt shards were too cheap and plentiful. The RNG of finding a geode alone didn't balance it in my eyes. Amethyst Clusters were harder to obtain though, enough that I felt they justified the near-diamond level performance of amethyst tools. After playtesting though, they were a bit too hard to obtain, so I added the feature of destroying budding blocks to obtain them in early game. That made it balanced imo.
